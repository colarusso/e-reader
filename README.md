# A Simple eReader

A simple e-reader for txt files. Specify the file you want to view by appending a `file` parameter to the URL with the path and name of a .txt file (e.g.,`?file=texts/story_name.txt`). Keep in mind, however, that it can only read files on the same domain. See for example: [https://colarusso.github.io/e-reader/?file=texts/The%20Purloined%20Letter.txt](https://colarusso.github.io/e-reader/?file=texts/The%20Purloined%20Letter.txt)
